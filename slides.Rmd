# (a) Causal problem
]

In Wilson's (2018) study 1, the researchers hypothesized that inmates who look less trustworthy were more likely to receive death sentences.

The research's aim is to infer the *population average treatment effect* (PATE) of receiving a sentence among potential inmates as predicted by: 


???

In this presentation we will go over the main results, highlight its main findings, strengths and weaknesses

--


- Facial trustworthiness, 
- Afrocentricity, 
- Attractiveness, 
- Facial maturity, 
- Facial width-to-height ratio, 
- Presence of glasses, and 
- Presence of tattoos.

### Effects plot of the ANOVA

.pull-left[
As can be seen in the figure, there was no interaction between race and trustworthiness. Hence, race was omitted from the **logistic regression**.

# (d) Threats to validity and design tricks for improved validity.
]

-   No information concerning the scales for afrocentricity, attractiveness, facial maturity
-   Few participants with tattoos and glasses


--


Design element: **Nonequivalent dependent variable**

--

-   e.g., how ***friendly*** does the inmate look
-   e.g., how ***happy*** does the inmate look



???

We will talk more about threats to internal validity in the **weeknesses** section.

only 14 targets with tattoos and 7 with glasses


A nonequivalent dependent variable is a design element suggested by Campbell and is defined as something that's  affected by the treatment condition but independent of the dependent variable.

HOWEVER, friendliness and trust probably correlate - BUT we would need to test that.

Essentially make the raters judge them on perceived happiness and trustworthiness or freindliness and trustworthiness.

# (e) Key result
]

-   **Model 1**: Targets perceived as less trustworthy were more likely to be sentenced to death.


-   **Model 2**: Along with trustworthiness, Afrocentricity was negatively associated with the death sentence and fWHR and the presence of glasses were positively associated with the death sentence.

.center[
# (f) Effect size estimate(s)
]

**ANOVA** - $\eta_{\text{p}}^{2}$

-   Since partial eta squared always carries a positive bias, they could have also reported Omega squared Logistic regression - $\Delta{\text{x}^{2}}$ and Odds ratio.


-   Odds ratio was used as effect size for the individual predictors tested 

-   CI for Odds ratio was reported

-   $\Delta{\text{x}^{2}}$ was used to test the fit of the models

-   $R^2$ could have been reported to show variance elucidation in general


???

OR > 1 means an increasement in Odds, and OR  < 1 means a decreasement in Odds

$\Delta{\text{x}^{2}}$: (Does the data deviate significantly from the assumptions of the model? -> Significance shows that the model does not fit well)

# Strengths and weaknesses.

.center[
# Strengths 
]

--


**Real inmates**: Construct validity & External validity 

???
-> People who have actually been convicted are used in the study. Actual measurement of inmates means that we are measuring people who have been convicted

--

**Matching**: Internal/Construct validity 

???
-> They have equal groups and pave the way for making causal inferences

--

**Grayscale images**: Construct validity 

???
-> Death sentence and life sentence inmates wear different colored clothes; thus grayscale images hinder the possibility of participants guessed/knew what sentence inmates received a priori. This constitutes blinding of outcome among raters.

--

**Well defined sample**, restricted on sex and race: Internal validity/Construct validity 

???
Almost complete "population" of death sentenced inmates in sample (given sex and race). Big sample size (observations among participants) which increases our confidence in the causal conclusion.

--

**Different raters for trustworthiness and covariates**: Construct validity

???
The ratings of trust don't affect the ratings of the covariates (continuation of "biased" pattern does not continue (IF there was a pattern))

---
.center[
# Weaknesses
]

--

**Unequal inmates with glasses and tattoos** making them hard to infer about

???
All types of validity ->
- 14 people with tattoos [7/7 in each group]
- 115 with glasses [50/65 in each group]
- 742 observations in total 

--

**Low Cronbach’ s Alpha**: Statistical conclusion validity 

???

-> .72 for trust which has the highest coefficient of determination $R^2$ 
Note: 8 point scale, it is perhaps unintuitive – however using a finer scale leads to a loss in variability in the answers.

--

**Info given to participants unclear**: Internal/Construct validity 

???
Hard to replicate this study, even given data and OS, on the basis that we have no clue what prior to the study about the inmates

--

**Photos taken after sentencing**: Internal validity 

???
-> Perhaps a death sentence has an effect on perceived trustworthiness compared to life sentence. 


--


- *Reverse causation* is a possibility here. 


--

**Age not controlled for**: Internal/Construct validity 


???
Potential confounder; IF it is a confounder, then it is related to BOTH outcome) and exposure
